As someone who loves both art and psychology, design has always attracted me. How often do you get a chance to both impress AND manipulate someone? When something is well designed, it feels like it reaches into my head and fiddles with the knobs and buttons. Why did I press this and then pull that? Well, I'm not sure, it just felt right.

Poorly designed things, by contrast, feel like acting without knowing the lines: there's _clearly_ a correct sequence here, if you could just figure it out! Everyone else seems to know their part, but you just keep missing the cues.

Both you and I experience thousands of interactions a day that land somewhere between these extremes, and each one was, at one point, designed. Whether it is opening a door, flipping a light switch, calling an elevator, or buttoning a shirt, each of these systems was (some more thoughtfully than others) created with you in mind. This is the central theme of Don Norman's 'The Design of Everyday Things': the world around us depends on design, and how things are designed can have massive influence over the people who use them.

I'd highly encourage anyone interested in design to read this book. To that end, I'll also include the fact that if you search the title on your search platform of choice, one of the first links is the full PDF of the book for free! I see why this is so often recommended to design students. It will truly change the way you view the world around you.

This book was actually the inspiration for a series I'm hoping to start and host here: I want to share pictures of all of the bad design that I see in my daily life: all the doors labeled 'push' or 'pull' or signs telling you where you need to order. These small signposts are, to me, wonderful reminders of how pervasive design is, as the vast majority of your interactions day to day don't need explicit instructions. Now, our ability to navigate the world without explicit directions at every turn is due to more than just design (as the book talks in detail about), but a well designed world certainly helps keep the train on the tracks.

For a particular example that I found especially interesting, consider the burners on your stove. How are the controls for these burners configured? Now take a look at this fantastic illustration from chapter three:

![Four stove top layouts with burner controls in different configurations|568x232](/burners.png)

All of these layouts are perfectly valid and all four stoves are usable - however, the bottom two don't require labels to intuitively understand which knobs control which burner. This might seem small on the surface, and once you've used the stove a few times you will likely have memorized the layout regardless, but small changes can make a big difference. At worst, it is slightly more delightful to use your stove. At best, it could prevent a fire.

All of this to say, I thouroughly enjoyed this book. If you are a designer who hasn't read it, do. If you aren't a designer, I think it's still worth a read - particularly the first three chapters. Design plays an essential role in all of our lives, every day, in almost every interaction we have with the objects in the world around us, and ironically because things are carefully designed, many of us never have to think about it! But lifting the curtain and learning how the people who make the things we use think has applied a fresh coat of paint to the world around me.

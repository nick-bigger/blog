This is just a really good movie. All of the characters work well together, and the outcome is a team that actually feels like a family. I was really happy to see that the humor was done sparingly and was not over the top in the way that a lot of Marvel movies tend to use it.

I think everyone in the cast is pulling their weight here, and that's helped by a good script which plays to each actors strength. Though I'm not the biggest fan of Pedro Pascal, his Reed feels convincing and vulnerable; Joseph Quinn and Ebon Moss-Bachrach have a great back and forth that entertains without getting in the way of the plot; and Vanessa Kirby plays a Sue Storm who feels genuinely powerful alongside the other three.

Without getting into spoilers, I'll add that the villains here were great as well. I do, however, think this movie needed 20 more minutes or so to really sell us on the stakes and possibly to develop a few of the side characters a bit more. Overall, absolutely worth a watch and easily my favorite iteration of the Fantastic Four.

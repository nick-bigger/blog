my love left me
now my hearts out looking for shelter

i need a foster
won't you let me into your happy home ?

your mama told you not to play with broken toys
promise i won't bother you much
you're not supposed to bring the stray dogs home
but all i really needs for you to throw me a bone

i'm home all alone
i need a distraction, babe
this old broken heart
can't kill this attraction, hey

i promise to love you
til the sun brings me home

i'm all broken down
this hearts in too many pieces
to run it around

but i promise to love you
until the sun brings me home

oh can't you hear me praying ?
i'm broken down upon my knees
but that don't mean i can't play
just don't expect my company

your mom might have told you that talking to strangers
ain't such a good thing
but now that you're grown
you know all the good things that bad things can bring

come help me find my way out of that dark
i know that what you'll find is pleasing
i need your loving like a lighter needs a spark
so save me now cause i'm barely breathing

i'm home all alone
i need a distraction, babe
this old broken heart
can't kill this attraction, hey

i promise to love you
til the sun brings me home

i'm all broken down
this hearts in too many pieces
to run it around

but i promise to love you
until the sun brings me home

god i love the show
the way you call me 'baby'
even though you know
that it's only for today
girl let's take it slow
my heart's broken down and bleeding

but that's hard to feel with your lips so near...

your mom might have told you that talking to strangers
ain't such a good thing
your mom might have told you that talking to strangers
ain't such a good thing
your mom might have told you that talking to strangers
ain't such a good thing

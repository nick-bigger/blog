I've never been much of a visual artist. But, I've always been interested in becoming one ! So, over the last couple months I've been trying to improve at drawing. Up till a few weeks ago, I had only really used pencil on paper and most drawings I've made have been simple shapes and eyes for practice. But, after visiting [Dim's Hotel](https://dimden.dev), I was totally taken by the pixel art. I've always had an affinity for the pixelated aesthetic, and I think you can really get some amazing art out of it; I absolutely adored games like Celeste and Animal Well.

And pixel art has always seemed to me, at least on the surface, to be a bit easier than visual art in a traditional medium. There are more rules - literal constraints on where you can actually draw in a grid - so it appeared like a good stepping stone in my artistic journey. I decided I'd try and create a pixel avatar for my website in the style of Dimden's and see if my intuition was correct, or if perhaps I showed some inate talent in this medium that I lacked in others.

## The Tools

I started by poking around to find some recommended tools for making this kind of art. Very quickly it became apparent that [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org) was the widely recommended choice, and I can now say for good reason ! Not only does it have a fantastic UI that is dripping with personality and pixelated-cuteness, it's just really fun and easy to use. Certainly less intimidating than something like Illustrator, which I've also used.

I did have a minor snafu attempting to actually buy the thing: you have to do a bit of an awkward shuffle purchasing on the Aseprite website and then downloading via HumbleBundle, which normally wouldn't be too much of a headache, but I used different emails for the two. So my key was redeemed to an account on HumbleBundle which did not exist, and I was subjected to multiple days of attempting to work with their customer service. In the end that's not really Aseprite's fault though, and I did finally get the app downloaded.

## The Attempts

As mentioned, Aseprite is quite intuitive to use, and I'm never one to read the instructions, so I just started creating and learned as I go. The first thing that I learned, however, is that colors in pixel art are _very_ important. In absence of things like hatch shading, almost all the depth that you give your art comes from subtle changes in pixel color. This did not come intuitively to me, and often I'd feel like the colors we're totally off until I slightly zoomed out - then all of a sudden my eyes would "recognize" the shadows and understand the depth.

However, this means that the first attempt was, perhaps, a bit flat:

A good friend described this as '...a jumpscare character in a old arcade game in the 80s'. For those of you who don't know what I look like, this was (I hope) an indication that the art did not accurately reflect the model. I think what really went wrong here is, first, the shape of my head is all kinds of wrong and, second, the lack of definition in the face and eyes really gives this a haunting visage.

In the second attempt, I worked to give a bit of shape - to my face and eyes, but also to the hair. This was... marginally successful:

Personally, I thought the eyes were a big improvement, and the addition of a nose certainly helped define a face. However, upon consulting a third party, they informed me that this one looked like I had been "...hit in the nuts... and youâ€™re trying to hold in your tears of pain".

Obviously, some serious revisions were necessary. I consulted a few YouTube videos on making pixel art (mainly [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCYn353lDRU)) and searched around Dribbble for a few examples of pixel art avatars. This was enourmously helpful.

I was going for a bit of a cartoony style, and this meant the proportions and composition were quite different from the more realistic eyes I had been drawing. This also provided me with some excellent examples of how important the shading really was to defining the shape of a face! I revisited my design and completely re-did the eyes, added more shading, and started to give the clothing a bit of shape as well. I actually started to see myself in the final result, and I think this was a huge turning point in the overall piece !!

Now that I was happy with the face, and my third party had indicated that this was "much better," I started adding a bit of detail. I tweaked the hair, added additional shading, defined the face shape a touch more, and really started giving some personality to the clothing. In this case, that meant adding some shameless self promotion by having him (me) wear my band's t-shirt. :)

Honestly, I'm really psyched with what came out in the end. This was such a fun project and a totally new medium for me and, though it was a bit of trial and error, I do feel like this contributed a lot to my overall mission of improving my visual art. Specifically, I feel I improved my eye for shadows, and increased my understand of how even slight differentiation in colors can really trick your eyes into percieving depth where there isn't any.

But ! This wasn't the end. As you've probably seen on the home page, I went on to animate the avatar in Aseprite as well, but I'll save that for another post. :D

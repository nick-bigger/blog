faithful as a river runs
down into the sea
and long beyond the last day
that you said you loved me

i will hold these memories
the cross that i bare
they won't wash away with the rain
or the warm summer air

just as the sweet kiss of the waves, with time
will pulverize the shore
so too do i wait here for you my dear
to wash me out once more

i hardly recognize this place you've made
with such a heavy hand
you've made molehills out of mountains
and dust out of a man

and i
know the pain of loving someone
on whom you couldn't depend

and i
know it's not love if you must sacrifice yourself
each time you defend

oh but i
wouldn't hesitate to put the broken pieces back together in the end
faithfully i'll mend
us, again

most a man, would've cut and ran
and left you at the door
to be honest, dear, i've thought the same
so many times before

but each time i've stayed, and you have made
your way across the floor
i've worn down with the hinges
and they don't stay closed anymore

won't you let me hold you closer dear
she's thinking of the door
for your warmth's my only sustenance
and i fear there's no more

the sweet bouquet of love's decay
hangs heavy in the air
i ask "are you wearing something new, my love?"
as she does up her hair

and i
know the pain of loving someone
on whom you couldn't depend

and i
know it's not love if you must sacrifice yourself
each time you defend

oh but i
wouldn't hesitate to put the broken pieces back together in the end
faithfully i'll mend
us, again

honey i'm burning
and you're in the glow
beautiful flames lick the walls
of our home

rafters will smolder
as you walk away
and all of the colors
give way to the grey

i feel my skin start to crumble
and fold
but all i can seem to feel
is the cold

the door - i'm praying it's locked
like i did when you came
but it's not

these doors don't seem to do much anymore
(can't keep you in can't keep you out)
these doors don't seem to do much anymore
(can't keep you in can't keep you out)
these doors don't seem to do much anymore
(can't keep you in can't keep you out)
these doors don't seem to do much anymore
(can't keep you in can't keep you out)

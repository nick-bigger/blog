In theory, I think that this is an excellent concept that has ample opportunity to make meaningful statements about COVID times, groupthink, political division, etc.

In practice, however, the breeding grounds were perhaps too fertile - in other words, this film tries to hit hard on so many points that none of them really ring cleanly to me. The twisting plot and rapid tonal shifts resulted in big moments losing their fire. Though each scene seemed to have its own purpose, I was rarely sure what the movie as a whole was really trying to say.

The acting, however, was great: every character felt real, and there were multiple moments for characters and actors to shine alike. Joaquin Phoenix really nailed Joe Cross in all of his many iterations. I think shelling out for Pedro Pascal was an odd choice here (other than the fact he's seemingly been the go-to male lead in everything recently) given how little he actually shows up. But, when he is on screen, he does a good job. Deirdre O'Connell particularly shined as the mother in law, in my opinion.

Lastly, I'll say that I loved the creativity in the way things were shot - there was some really unique camerawork which brought certain scenes to the next level. I think that quite a few of the small and quiter moments shined, which is a testament to Ari Aster's vision and execution of this screenplay.

I really wanted to love this, and I think with an editing pass to change, slim down, or outright remove some scenes, the overall message (and arc) might have become a bit clearer. In the end, it was undoubtedly entertaining, well acted, and creative. But without a clear message to the story, it felt a bit like just a painful reminder of how bad things are - a fact which, I think, most of us are all well acquainted with at this point!

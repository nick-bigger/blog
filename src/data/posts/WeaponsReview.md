Unlike most, it seems, I didn't see any of the marketing for this movie; I hadn't seen or heard of Barbarian; I hadn't even learned yet that Zach Cregger was a director. In other words, I had no expectations for this movie beyond the fact that it was a movie and was supposed to be scary.

First, to give credit where it is due, the cinematography in this movie is great. The camera work that Cregger employs throughout brings a critical energy and intensity to many scenes. Creative framing and movement of the camera throughout scenes kept the audience engaged, and his use of extreme camera angles accentuated the stomach-dropping, heart-pumping horror movie moments we all love to great effect. And this wasn't limited to jump scares or action sequences - these tactics were employed equally well for humor.
The persistent and ever-present comedy in this movie was something I was unprepared for! Even others who saw the marketing felt similarly. And it was this comedic horror double-tone that was one of the greatest strengths and weaknesses of this movie.

Almost every horror-type "jab" was followed by an equally powerful comedic "cross." I'd argue that the balance of these two forces underpinned the entire plot, and, for the most part, I think Cregger balanced them well. The repeated switching of tone created a certain anxiety that I think is desirable in most horror movies. Will this scene make me laugh or scream? Who can say.

But when these two forces fell out of balance, they would undercut each other. Great moments of terror would suddenly lose their bite; big laughs would be cut short; the extreme hot and cold of both would become a more tolerable lukewarm. I especially felt this at the end, where the dramatic confrontation of the big bad instead became a drawn-out comedic bit. Both the comedy and the horror, when employed, are done well, but in my opinion, they are done best in this movie when they are binary. I don't think this is trying to be Scary Movie, but the intermixing of the two tones does sometimes take it in that direction.

All of that said, the plot itself, I think, is brilliant. The non-linear telling of the story was particularly unique and exciting. Scenes are repeated multiple times from different perspectives, and with the new information you gain in each, the story itself unfolds like a flower. This is guided along by strong performances from all, with particular praise for Julia Garner and Benedict Wong, who I think brought their A-game.

To sum up, much like Longlegs, I think this movie was a victim of misleading advertising, which poorly sold the final product. If you are expecting the "horror movie of the year", this is not that. I thought that 28 Years Later was scarier and Together was funnier. But though both movies had similar moments of horror and comedy, I don't think either balanced the two as well as Weapons does.

As usual, I have way too many personal projects going at once. But I really wouldn't have it any other way! I thought it might be fun going through and discussing my progress with each of my current projects:

## Skateboarding

I've always wanted to be able to Skateboard. And, to be honest, all signs indicate that I _should_ be good at it: I'm a very good snowboarder, a decent surfer... I've tried almost all of the board sports out there you can imagine, and a good chunk of them I was decent at.

The problem? I'm not good at Skateboarding. In fact, I'm like the opposite of naturally talented at it. The first time I tried to learn I broke my collar bone. The second time I disclocated my shoulder. I've gathered quite a few eggs in the 'third times a charm' basket.

At this point I can kick around confidently. I've even had a couple sessions at the park where I worked on rolling in and out of quarter pipes. My biggest next goal is learning to ollie, as that will unlock a whole world that's been off limits to me. I've been practicing in the grass, but have yet to really get comfortable enough to try one on solid ground.

## Drawing

This is probably the skill that I am the newest at (and the most uncomfortable with). I have always been an artistic person, but visual arts have long been an area that I just wasn't any good at. Whereas music, writing, even dance came somewhat naturally to me, when it came to drawing, painting, and the like, there always seemed to be a disconnect between my hand and my brain.

I've spent most of my time recently trying to reconcile this gap. Given I never had a formal education for visual arts, it's been a lot of the basics! I've mainly stuck to daily practice and self-education using YouTube videos. A few videos that have been particularly useful are [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKiopm83L8c&t=142s) and [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUKZMqQtz2w&t=278s).

So far, progress has been pretty good. I try to draw at least _something_ every day, even if it's small or simple line work like those videos talk about. Perspective still really bends my brain - I have a lot of chairs and tables I've drawn that just don't look quite right - but I do think that I am getting slightly better. I've definitely become more connected with my hand.

I had a lot of fun at the beginning drawing eyes. Maybe if I add an area to the sight I can upload some pictures! For now, my eye-drawing has stagnated mostly because my shading is off, perspective needs work, and eyelashes just always look wrong. Alas! We persist.

## Design

As I've said elsewhere on this site, I'm a software engineer for my day job. I really enjoy writing code, and I think there is a real, under-appreciated art to writing clean, functional, readable code. However, in the world of software creation, I think the real art comes from the world of UI/UX (User Interface/User Experience). For a long time, this was an entire world that I had little interaction with, though I'd often find myself peering over the fence.

I could (and probably will) write a whole article just about my love for UI/UX. Using a well designed system feels like running on pavement instead of sand; everything just flows naturally. You find yourself hovering over the button you need before you needed it - the software meets your hand at every point like looking in a mirror. There can be an incredible dance between human and machine when software is designed well. Okay, enough, I'll save this for its own post.

I've long loved videos like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXpxZMRM1EY) or [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YElVQqNwrJ4) which beautifully disect the intricacies of design. I've also been reading an incredible book called [The Design of Everyday Things](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/840.The_Design_of_Everyday_Things) which I cannot recommend more. And lastly, and perhaps obviously, I built this website :) so you get to play a cool roll in this whole journey too!

## Writing

Speaking of this website, the last big project I'm working on is writing itself. And you are reading the progress! I've been in love with creative writing as long as I can remember. In fact, one thing that often got me in trouble in high school was my ability to write an extremely compelling sounding essay with very little actual content, which I'd argue requires quite a bit of creativity.

However, most of my truly creative writing has been short-form. A few months ago, I was talking with my soon-to-be sister in law who had written and published her own short story. Writing an actual book has always been something I've loved the idea of, and here was someone I knew who simply went out and did it. So, why not me?

But, when I went to try my hand at writing my own short story, as so often happens with things that on the surface don't seem to difficult, it was far more difficult than I thought it would be. In the short-form mediums I am used to writing in, mainly song lyrics and poetry, every word requires deep and intense consideration. Sitting in front of a blank page, I found that I just couldn't escape that thought process. After a few hours, I had only a handful of sentances. And - beautiful as they were - a few sentances does not a book make!

So, I commited to sitting down and trying to get better at my medium-form writing. As you may have seen on the front page, it's actually this months goal! I've been trying to sit down every day and write _something_, whether that be a longer poem or this very blog post. Hopefully, this practice will translate to my long-form content as well. Oh yeah, the short story I'm working on is tentatively called 'The Man and the Moon.' I'm sure you'll be hearing more about it soon.

I'm a firm believer in a daily creative practice. It doesn't matter if you're good; creating art is not a hobby, it's human. I don't care to be the best at any of these hobbies, or really any hobby for that matter. I create because I love it, because I can't help but to do it, and because it makes me human. My life and the joy that I glean from living it _is_ my greatest work of art.

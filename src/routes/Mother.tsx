      <p>to be fair you prepared the most beautiful breakfast</p>
      <p>and though I was sick, kissed my cheek</p>
      <p className="pt-8">It's so clear I could swear that it's real</p>
      <p>they're in your arms and you are in mine</p>
      <p>in that dream every hardship i've ever endured</p>
      <p>has meaning and I know that i'm fine</p>

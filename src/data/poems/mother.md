I just know that you'll be the best mother

I've been dreaming about it all week

to be fair you prepared the most beautiful breakfast

and though I was sick, kissed my cheek

&nbsp;

It's so clear I could swear that it's real

they're in your arms and you are in mine

in that dream every hardship i've ever endured

has meaning and I know that i'm fine
